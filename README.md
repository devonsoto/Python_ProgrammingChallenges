# Python3-Scripts

Here is some detailed information about the Python3 scripts that I have written for fun. 
If you can offer feedback on how to improve my code or ways to make it more efficient please do. 

-'EmailVerification.py' : This script verifies a n number of emails and then sorts them into a list.
               
               
  How to run: Use python3 to run the code. The script will ask the user to enter n
              number of emails. Then the user will enter n number of emails. If the
              email is valid then it will append it to a list if not it will print
              a message describing why it was not valid. Once the script is finished
              it will print a sorted list of all the emails.
