# Python3-Scripts

Here is some detailed information about the Python3 scripts that I have written for fun. 
If you can offer feedback on how to improve my code or ways to make it more efficient please do. 

- `EmailVerification.py` - This script verifies a n number of emails and then sorts them into a list.

- `CoinDenomination.py` - This script uses a greedy algorithm that makes change for n cents with different coin denominations.

- `medianTwoarrays.py` - This script gets the median of two combined sorted arrays, 

- `ValidPassword.py` - This script determines whether or not a password is valid. There are multiple test cases at the bottom of the program.

- `MinMaxSum.py` - This program will output the minimum and maximum sum of five integers inputted by the user.
